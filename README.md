Alienvault-VulnerabilityAssessments
===================================

This is a basic module that allows for the application of the risk metrics to Nessus / OpenVAS scan results. 

Thanks to PacketInspector for the basic syntax for the OpenVAS config file. 

Using this module
====

1. Copy the backfill_plugin_sid.pl script to the /etc/cron.daily folder. As it stands not all events are categorized. This makes sure we have complete, accurate numbers. 
2. Open openvas.cfg to /etc/ossim/agent/plugins. 
3. Enable the plugin. 
4. Run a vulnerability scan. 
5. Any vulnerability with a risk >=1 will create an alarm.   

Removing False Positives
====

Every vulnerability scan produces a certain number of false positives. 
To reliably remove these from future scans (aka create a baseline) perform the following steps. 

1. Open Threat Intelligence. 
2. Open Data Source 'nessus' / 3001. 
3. Search for the event type ID (more reliable then discription) and adjust the priority and reliability down. I suggest 0/0 for false positives. 
4. Apply the changes. 
5. Run alienvault-reconfig (to be on the safe side).
